fpac (4.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Change the way we install conf files in /etc/ax25. Install the
    defaults, if they don't already exist. If they do exist, install
    them with a .dist extension, so we don't clobber existing files. The
    "make installconf" target is no longer required to install config files.
  * Remove the dependency on the SVNREV file, we're not currently using
    that.
  * Change how we do variable substitution in pathnames.h to make
    debugging easier.
  * Update Debian packaging files to latest compatibility.
  * Fail configure script if any of the required header files are
    missing.

fpac (4.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tomi made a mistake in his code by not including a term_handler.
    I suppose he figured grouping it in the
    signal_handler routine would be enough but it isn't. Node may receive
    the signal but it doesn't know quite enough to terminate the session
    thus leaving it open. Adding the term_handler will insure proper closure
    of the node. Newer compilers may accept this now, but I am not sure.
    Considering G4APL's node GB7CIP was hit by this exploit last year I can
    only think it still exists. I discovered this bug quite a while ago but
    didn't understand what was going on until I did a trace via gdb.
