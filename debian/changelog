fpac (4.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Change the way we install conf files in /etc/ax25. Install the
    defaults, if they don't already exist. If they do exist, install
    them with a .dist extension, so we don't clobber existing files. The
    "make installconf" target is no longer required to install config files.
  * Remove the dependency on the SVNREV file, we're not currently using
    that.
  * Change how we do variable substitution in pathnames.h to make
    debugging easier.
  * Update Debian packaging files to latest compatibility.
